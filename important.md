Things to FIX:
 - Frontend:
 	- Merge the create and edit views into one to avoid code repetition
	- Remove the option to sort the actions in the data-table
	- Fix historic view updating imediately
	- Improve overall look
	- Dashboard with introduction and statistics
    - Tooltips on icons
    - Person profile and resource profile
    - Move the action icons into buttons
 - Backend:
 	- Input verification
	- Fix reservation state to include "finished" and "cancelled"
	- Change the date type to be an actual Date instead of a String

After this is done, put it into a github hosted repository


Things I would like to do if I had more time:
 - Better input verification
 - Error handler system
 - Unit and system tests
 - Change the date type to be an actual Date instead of a string
